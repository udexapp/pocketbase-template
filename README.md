# UDEX Pocketbase Backend

## Instructions
1. Create a new Repository based on this **pocketbase-template**
2. Create a **dev** branch in the new Repository based on the **main** branch
3. Create a **prod** branch in the new Repository based on the **main** branch
4. Connect the **dev** branch to the **dev** hosting environment (for automatic deployment when changes are made)
5. Connect the **prod** branch to the **prod** hosting environment (for automatic deployment when changes are made).

## Important:
1. On top of the **dev** branch, create additional branches (e.g. **dev-name1**) in which you do ongoing development (**Locally** or in a **CodeSandbox** or **StackBlitz**, etc. environment), then merge changes to the **dev** branch
2. After testing the **dev** branch, you can merge changes to the **prod** branch

## P.S.
For hosting you can use **railway.app**, **fly.io**, etc.
